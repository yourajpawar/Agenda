# Agenda

Hi there,

App: Agenda Calendar App v 1.0 (Swift 3.0, iOS 10.1)

Due to busy schedule these days, i tried to contribute whenever got a chance. It's not a perfect app. Just tried to demo it's features. (AutoLayout constraints are not right, i've to spend some time for it, not sure when)

# Please run on iPhone 6 or iPhone 7 portrait layout only. 

Features:

1. Shows current weather at top bar above calendar. (SFO weather)
2. Shows calendar and tableview below calendar. 
3. Tableview shows agenda for the day.
3. Data has been randomly generated by a structure function in app on app start.
4. For demo purpose data is loaded for dates 6 days prior and 6 days after from todays date.
5. Scrolling  agenda tableview will update calendar date and agenda and selecting dates on calendar will update agenda table view with selected day agenda
6. Model of app can be found in Model folder and Network part in Network folder.


P.S. Calendar View used in app is third party. But i've to spent some time converting to Swift 3
